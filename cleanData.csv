"745","will not be back"
"746","there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat"

"766","nonfancy"
"767","good food both the hot  sour  the egg flower soups were absolutely  starsmy sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tastelessgreat time  family dinner on a sunday nightthe food is not tasty at all"
"768","was the slow servicethe flair bartenders are absolutely amazingtheir frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my tastethese were so good we ordered them twiceso in a nutshell  the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewermy girlfriends veal was very badunfortunately"
"769","or in this case"
"770","which im no fan of"
"771","but it does everything pretty wellthe staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries"
"772","and court staffgreat atmosphere"
"773","and guess what he was sick all night tooso good i am going to have to review this place twice  once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last nightthe chips and salsa were really good"
"774","but unfortunately the taste fell flat"
"775","the mozzarella sticks"
"776","i still tell people how awesome the duck wasthe server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this placethe service was terrible thoughthis place is overpriced"
"777","and it really is overpricedit was packedi love this placei can say that the desserts were yummythe food was terriblethe seasonal fruit was fresh white peach pureeit kept getting worse and worse so now im officially donethis place should honestly be blown upbut i definitely would not eat here againdo not waste your money herei love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxesthe crpe was delicate and thin and moistawful servicewont ever go here againfood quality has been horriblefor that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gonethe service here is fair at besti do love sushi"
"778","overhip and underservicesdo yourself a favor and stay away from this dishvery poor serviceno one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for itbest service and food ever"
"779","i really expect better foodthe food came out at a good pacei ate there twice on my last visit"
"780","just because she was so awesometo my disbelief"
"781","i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people"
"782","wash dishes otherwisethe potatoes were great and so was the biscuiti probably would not go here againso flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heatthe price is reasonable and the service is greatthe wife hated her meal coconut shrimp"
"783","eithermy fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealingwent in for happy hour"
"784","nice little vibe in the restauranttalk about great customer service of course we will be backhot dishes are not hot"
"785","no gloveseverything is deep fried in oili love their fries and their beansalways a pleasure dealing with himthey have a plethora of salads and sandwiches"
"786","this is the place to gothe service was great"
"787","but im editing it to give it only onethis is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcosall in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service"
"788","and a beautiful settingmy boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experienceweird vibe from ownersthere was hardly any meative had better bagels from the grocery storego to place for gyrosi love the ownerchef"
"789","the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorlessi found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsathe service was terrible"
"790","and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my platei had about two bites and refused to eat anymorethe service was extremely slowafter  minutes wait"
"791","and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanutsmy boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in lovetheir rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this placepricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroomworst thai everif you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least oncei want to first say our server was great and we had perfect servicethe pizza selections are goodi had strawberry tea"
"792","a great experiencespend your money elsewheretheir regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmmthe buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipatedand the drinks are weak"
"793","i feel like the chips are bought"
"794","very sadi felt insulted and disrespected"
"795","i dont understandim not impressed with the concept or the foodthe only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puredthere is really nothing for me at postinos"
"796","yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for usneedless to say"
"797","i see caring teamwork to a professional degreethe ri style calamari was a jokehowever"
"798","it was barely ediblei could barely stomach the meal"
"799","i had lost the heart to finish itit also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for itwe arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this onedisappointing experiencethe food is about on par with dennys"
"800","not good at allif you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service"
"801","ridiculousdont bother coming herethe meat was pretty dry"
"802","the bathroom is pretty trippy"
"803","seemed thin and watered down with no heatit was a bit too sweet"
"804","and lacked flavori was very disappointedthis place is horrible and way overpricedmaybe its just their vegetarian fare"
"805","but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuitscon spotty servicethe fries were not hot"
"806","disappointment ensuedthe real disappointment was our waitermy husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anythingthe only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomachinsults"
"807","and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify itif someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cartshe was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her doorafter all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointmentdel taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possibleits not hard to make a decent hamburgerbut i dont like ithell no will i go backweve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restauranti dont know what the big deal is about this place"
"808","it only set us up for disapppointment with our entreesthe food wasnt goodyour servers suck"
"809","correction"
"810","i really wanted to like this placeoverpriced for what you are gettingi vomited in the bathroom mid lunchi kept looking at the time and it had soon become  minutes"
"811","and this tops the listwe started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt freshfood was below averageit sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurantall in all"
"812","seemed undercooked"
"813","and i think well just go to ninja sushi next timethen"
